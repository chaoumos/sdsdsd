This is your first post. Welcome to your new Astro site, **dsdsdsdsd**!

You can start editing this file or add new posts in the `src/content/blog/` directory. This site is pre-configured with Tailwind CSS.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a modern static site builder that focuses on content-rich websites. It allows you to build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript.

### Key Features:

*   **Component-based:** Use your favorite UI components (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.) or Astro's own `.astro` components.
*   **Content-focused:** Great for blogs, documentation, portfolios, and marketing sites.
*   **Performance:** Ships zero JavaScript by default for most UI components, leading to faster load times.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** This template comes with Tailwind CSS setup for utility-first styling.

Happy blogging!
